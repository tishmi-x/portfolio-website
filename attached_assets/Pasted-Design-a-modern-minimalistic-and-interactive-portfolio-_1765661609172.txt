Design a modern, minimalistic, and interactive portfolio website for a Computer Science undergraduate. The website should feel clean, thoughtful, and slightly playful, reflecting curiosity, learning, and early-stage growth as a developer. Use smooth animations, subtle interactions, and a refined visual hierarchy.

Overall Website Structure

Sections (in order):

Hero (Home)

Myself (About)

Skills

Achievements

Contact

A sticky navigation bar should be present at the top with smooth scrolling to sections.
Instagram and GitHub icons should be fixed at the top-right corner across all sections, linking to the user’s profiles.

Color Scheme & Style

Use the following palette consistently:

White: #FFFFFF (primary background / text contrast)

Cool Gray: #D0D1C9 (secondary background, subtle sections)

Black: #000000 (primary text)

Blue Accent: #007FA3 (highlights, links, hover states)

Purple Accent: #6D247A (secondary accent for emphasis)

Overall style: modern, minimal, student-hackathon aesthetic, inspired by interactive portfolio showcases.

Typography

Use a modern font pairing:

Headings: Space Grotesk (bold, geometric, contemporary)

Body text: Inter (highly readable, clean, professional)

Maintain strong typographic hierarchy with generous spacing.

1. Hero Section (Home)
Content

Circular center-aligned avatar based on the user’s photo

A broad rotating circular border around the avatar with the text:
“Mishti Goel · Fresher”
The border text should rotate smoothly, inspired by the reference website.

Below the avatar:

Name (bold, large): Mishti Goel

Designation: Computer Science Undergraduate | Beginner Developer

Catchy line:
“Currently juggling assignments, problem-solving, curiosity, caffeine, and a little chaos.”

Include subtle SVG icons near the tagline (minimal, lightweight).

Design & Interaction

Center-aligned layout

Smooth rotation animation for the border

Minimal background with soft gradients or neutral tones

No CTA buttons in this section

2. Myself Section (About)
Layout

Split layout:

Left: Text content (bio)

Right: Interactive polaroid-style image stack

Images should appear as scattered polaroids with:

White frames

Soft shadows

Slight rotations

Layered using absolute positioning

Bio Content

Include a concise, readable version of the provided bio highlighting:

Growth of interest through problem-solving

Python beginnings, learning C

Enjoyment of logical clarity moments

Exploration of CS domains

Foundational HTML/CSS exposure

Curious, patient learning mindset

Interactions

On hover:

Top polaroid lifts, rotates slightly, and scales up

Smooth, subtle animations (no aggressive motion)

CSS or Framer Motion preferred

On mobile:

Images stack below text

Animations degrade gracefully

3. Skills Section
Heading

Skills

Layout

Create separate cards for each skill category

Each card should have:

Image/illustration box on one side

Text content on the other

Alternate layout direction for each category (left-right, right-left)

Skill Categories & Content

Programming

Python (basic)

C (learning)

DSA (learning)

Web

HTML (basic)

CSS (basic)

Concepts

Problem-solving

Competitive programming (beginner)

Data structures (basics)

Design

Minimal cards with soft shadows

Light hover interaction

Icons or abstract illustrations allowed

Clean spacing and readable typography

4. Achievements Section
Heading

Achievements

Layout

Right-aligned image or illustration

Left-aligned interactive achievement card

Achievement Content

🏆 DevJams Hackathon — Winner

Worked on structuring and designing the final presentation

Participated in ideation discussions and team decision-making

Gained experience working in a collaborative, time-constrained environment

Interaction

Card hover effects (lift, glow, or border accent)

Minimal but celebratory feel

Avoid clutter—focus on one highlighted achievement

5. Contact Section
Layout & Style

Inspired by the referenced “chat-style” contact section

Replicate the conversational UI layout

Replace email text with:
mishtigoelofficial@gmail.com

Color theme must match the rest of the website

Content

Chat-style message inviting contact

Below the chat:

SVG Instagram icon (linked)

SVG GitHub icon (linked)

Links

Email: mishtigoelofficial@gmail.com

LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/mishti-goel

GitHub: https://github.com/tishmi-x

Additional Requirements

Smooth scrolling between sections

Lightweight implementation

Consistent animation language throughout

Fully responsive design

Professional yet personal tone

The final result should feel like a thoughtfully designed student portfolio that balances minimalism, personality, and interactivity while clearly representing growth, curiosity, and potential.
